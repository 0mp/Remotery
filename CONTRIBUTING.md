Remotery Contribution Guidelines
================================

We want Remotery to be used by as many people as possible so it's important that the rights of both our authors and our users are strong and explicitly spelled out. For that reason, we use a Contributor License Agreement.

In simple terms, the CLA states that all Copyright belongs to the original authors and that they are in no way prevented from using their contributions in other ways. It also protects the project by asking that the authors explicitly state that they own the contributions and agree to transfer specific rights to the project.

To get setup:

1. Make sure you have a [Github][Github] account.
2. Fork your [own copy of Remotery](https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery/fork) to your account.
3. Read the [Indivdual CLA][Individual-CLA] completely, or if you are contributing on behalf of your company, the [Entity CLA][Entity-CLA].
4. Ensure you understand your rights and the rights of the project.
5. Add the comment "I agree" to the list in section 7 of either CLA that applies to you.

Use of comments in the CLA as a form of acceptance give several benefits:

* It directly links the contributor to the Github account from which they will submit contributions.
* Potential users of the library can see and verify for themselves that the project contributors have agreed to the CLA.
* Agreement is matched to whatever version of the CLA is in use at the time.
* No email addresses are required.
* The process is transparent for contributors, ensuring them that any of their details will not be used for any other purpose.
* Technically, the process is very simple, requiring no 3rd party CLA applcations.

The CLAs were created based on the [Project Harmony][Project-Harmony] templates, a detailed analysis of which is documented [here][Project-Harmony-Guide].
